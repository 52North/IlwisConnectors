Change when query is stored in resource:
----------------------------------------
    - change wfs.h signatures to consume Resource instead of QUrl
    - Actual QUrl has to be constructed depending on the base URL and its query
    - Create GetFOI QUrls in WfsContainerConnector and create Resources in WfsCatalogConnector
