* using networkReply->readAll() to feed xml network response to qtxmlstreamreader: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtcore/qxmlstreamreader.html

* IlwisObjectConnector constructor has unused bool 'load'

* Make CatalogConnector standalone so that ContainerConnectors can be created by a CatalogConnector instance only if needed

* Prepare WFS:
  - Change wfs.h signatures to consume Resource instead of QUrl => possible for just calling GC?
  - Actual QUrl has to be constructed depending on the base URL and its query
  
*  let WfsFeature inherit from resource. objects are created from DescribeFeatureType and can be used by featureconnector and tableconnector
