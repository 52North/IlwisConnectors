* do geometry parsing so that at least feature coverage domain type is present before parsing actual feature instance

* test if feature collection is parsed correctly when geometry type is in between attribute sequence

* how to distinguish plain table loading (itTABLE) from whole feature loading (itFEATURE)

* no GdalTableLoader.loadMetadata() call in GdalFeatureConnector

* unclear/confusing coding:
  - resources in signatures are sometimes QString &name, QUrl &url, QUrl &resource
  - which metadata, when, how? softtyping ...

* Make CatalogConnector standalone so that ContainerConnectors can be created by a CatalogConnector instance only if needed

* IlwisObjectConnector constructor has unused bool 'load'

* which return value when store() is called? GDAL returns true ...
