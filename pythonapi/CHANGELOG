--20140228--
*added DateTime support

--20140214--
*fixed issue on +datum=... param in proj definition

--20140210--
*first release build

--20140207--
*small changes of WKT representation of Geometries due to switch from boost to geos geometries
*no more extra Coordinate2D of Voxel - everything is handled by Coordinate or Pixel
*several bugfixes for import/export with ILWIS3 and GDAL connectors
*many more supportedformats
*added linear raster filter to the set of operations
*you can now query the possible operations and their syntax
*added most of the simple features methods to Geometry class

--20140124--

--20140110--
*improved Coordinate/Coordinate2D(new!)/Voxel/Pixel and Envelope(new!)/Box
*improved CoordinateSystem (added envelope() and __eq__()/__ne__())
*changed IlwisObject.store() to raise OSError's on fail (no more bool return value) and renamed connectTo to setConnection
*fixed ilwis3 georeference file naming (*.grf)
*added Geometry.transform for reprojection

--20131220--
*test.py is now unittest and autmatically skips tests if catalog(directory) could not be found
*added extra Python API Exceptions like ImportError and InvalidObjectException
*improved geometry integrity
*improved Size and Voxel functionality
*added Const.xxUNDEFs for constants (UNDEFs)

--20131213--
*added PixelIterator and various geometry helper classes like Voxel, Box and Size
*fixed WKT in/output for 3D geometries
*avoid access to "feature_id" attribute of the FeatureCoverage/Feature
*added conveniance functionality for attribute access of features (now with hidden PyVariant)
*removed uncought ERROR output on failed script execution
*replaced the single muteIssueLogger() by the complementary dis-/connectIssueLogger() functions
*fixed some issues on storing ilwis3 format files
*reorganised test.py to more modular testcases
!unresolved bug if create FeatureCoverage.newFeature(Geometry) before the binary data is loaded - please avoid that!

--20131205--
*first release to demonstrate some functionality of ILWIS NG using its new Python API
*contains classes like FeatureCoverage,RasterCoverage,PyVariant,FeatureIterator,Geometry,Feature,Engine, corrdinateSystem
