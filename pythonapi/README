ILWIS Python API

This folder contains only the python extension source (ilwisobjects.py) for
the classes wrapping the ILWIS functionality into a convenient API.
It does not contain the ilwiscore.dll and relating
plugins which the ilwis Python extention is linked to.

The ilwiscore.dll depends on Qt-libraries, so if you want to use the extension in your
python script, you need to be sure the PATH environment contains the following directories
before executing the pythonXX.exe.

<pathToQt>\Qt5.1.1\5.1.1\mingw48_32\bin   <- QtCore(d).dll, QtSQL(d).dll icudt51.dll, icuin51.dll, icuuc51.dll
<pathToILWIS>\                            <- ilwiscore.dll, <subdir>\<other_plugins>.dll

The extension is build with SWIG (http://www.swig.org)
