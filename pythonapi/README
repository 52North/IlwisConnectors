ILWIS Python API

The extension was built with SWIG (http://www.swig.org)

This folder contains only the python extension source (ilwisobjects.py) for
the classes wrapping the ILWIS functionality into a convenient API.
It does not contain the ilwiscore.dll and relating
plugins which the ilwis Python extention is linked to.


===============INSTALL==================
--1-- Python

Download the Version Python 3.3.3 from this source:
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.3/python-3.3.3.msi
During install procedure you can choose to add the installation directory to the PATH environment
which allows to execute the python.exe from every folder.

--2--  Qt & ILWIS Dlls

The ilwiscore.dll depends on Qt-libraries, so if you want to use the extension in your
python script, make sure that the PATH environment contains the following directories
before running the Python3.3 executable.

<yourPathToQt>\bin   <- QtCore(d).dll, QtSQL(d).dll icudt51.dll, icuin51.dll, icuuc51.dll
<yourPathToILWIS>\                            <- ilwiscore.dll, <subdir>\<other_plugins>.dll

The files test.sh and test.bat contain sample scripts to execute python test.py with correct PATH environment.
in order to use one of them you should adjust the addressed directories to your local filesystem (correct Drive).
The bash scipt prepare_PATH.sh can be used in bash like this ". ./prepare_PATH.sh" of "source ./prepare_PATH.sh"

The Qt library  requires the qt.conf file to be found in the executable path, which in this case is the path
to the Python33.exe. Within that config file the Prefix for Qt dynamic plugin loading is set to

Prefix = <yourPathToQt>\

--3--  ILWIS environment

During runtime our ilwiscore.dll loads some configuration files from the ILWIS directory,
which should be specified in the file "ilwisobjects.conf" like this:
ilwisDir=<yourPathToIlwis>/

The config file "ilwisobjects.conf" can be in the current directory
or in the directory of the executable (<yourPathToPython.exe>/).

The ILWIS directory will also contain a subdirectory log containing the log files of the last session.
Note: This way different sessions pointing to the same ILWIS directory, will overwrite their logfiles!
