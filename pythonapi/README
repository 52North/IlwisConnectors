ILWIS Python API

This folder contains only the binary python extension (ilwis.pyd) and
the Python sources for the classes wrapping the ILWIS functionality
into a convenient API. It does not contain the ilwiscore.dll and  relating
plugins which the ilwis Python extention is linked to.

The extension is build with SWIG (http://www.swig.org)
