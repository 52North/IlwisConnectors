Questions
- explorers are created and then checked if they can use a given resource => make this static as constructor may create state based on a resource which is not intended to be used by the checked resource
- pgconnector does provide itFEATURE, itTABLE, but omits provision of tDOMAIN, itCOORDSYSTEM, itRASTER, itGEOREF for now
