Doing
- check how to store things
-

findings list
- how to avoid doubled metadata loading?
- check if data is already loaded is not possible, as isDataLoaded is set by BaseTable before calling loadData

TODOs
- WFS Demo does not succeed (timeout server?, shp export not complete?)
- do some query optimizations (check double metadata loading issue beforehand)

Questions
- explorers are created and then checked if they can use a given resource => make this static as constructor may create state based on a resource which is not intended to be used by the checked resource
- how to add multiple geometries to one feature
-
